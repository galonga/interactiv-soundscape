### interactiv-soundscape

## What is this?

Windows Forms application from 2014 that uses ASIO to play 8 different sounds at the same time on 8 different audio channels. The player is controllable with a direct input device or over a rest API. 

## Hot to use?

You need a ASIO compatible soundcard (you can use ASIO4ALL as a driver for normal cards)
Putt your sounds into 'C:\SoundScape\'
Name the files:
background.mp3
sound1.mp3
sound2.mp3
sound3.mp3
sound4.mp3
sound1_leise.mp3
sound2_leise.mp3
